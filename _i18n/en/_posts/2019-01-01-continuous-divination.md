Continous Divination - website that during the exhibition continously generated horoscopes via one artificial intelligence and did a sentiment analysis on the output via another, gauging whether the output was positive or not. Text-to-speech output from the horoscope was read out into the room. Output can still be seen at http://guided-read-ii6f75sfda-lz.a.run.app/
